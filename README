Custom KeyMapper for Linux
------

Bash scripts made specially for DoTA Players and other games.

Skill keys in Dota can be customized through CustomKeys (Generate one from http://drjones.dk/customkeys/generator.php).
But under Linux, there no such tool for custom item keys, which is a pain as using items with mouse is really inconvenient.
Warkeys or any other tool doesn't run well with wine.

KeyMapper solves this problem. It uses xbindkeys and xmodmap to enable you to use custom keys for items as well.

Dependencies
------

* bash
* xmodmap
* xbindkeys

Usage
------

Make sure all the scripts in the folder are executable.
	chmod +x ./*

Start the KeyMapper with
	./KeyMapper

Stop with
	./KeyMapper_stop

When it starts, the mapping is not applied initially. The default shortcut for Toggling Custom Mapping is F7.
When enabled, the keys to which something is remapped to will act as that key and not its original function. You can quickly default the mapping by toggling again with F7.
Shortcuts can be changed by editing the ./xbindrc file.

For configuring mapping, see ./keys.conf file.
